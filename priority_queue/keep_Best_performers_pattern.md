So you have a problem in front of you and start to analyze it. You write down the observations and see
that question wants you to find the optimal value for some condition.
Now if the question has the following patterns :-

1. You are gettin the hunch of trying to find the optimal value for each possibility.
2. For each possibility you need to just have in your hand best "k" performers.
   => Use a priority queue to maintain your best hand and try out each possibility.

Trying out all possibility doesn't mean I'm talking about recursion problems.
Here it applies to questions where lets say you fix one end of a subarray then you need to find the best "k"
performers to its right or left using a PQ.

practice the following to get a good grasp ;)

## Leetcode 2542. Maximum Subsequence Score

_Leetcode 1383 is ditto(almost) same as above_

## Leetcode 502. IPO

## Leetcode 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers

_This one is a good one_

## Leetcode 2813. Maximum Elegance of a K-Length Subsequence##
