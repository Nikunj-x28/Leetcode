So you have a problem in front of you and start to analyze it. You write down the observations and see
that question wants you to find the optimal value for some condition.
Now if the question has the following patterns :-

1. You are gettin the hunch of trying to find the optimal value for each possibility.
2. For each possibility you need to just have in your hand best "k" performers.
   => Use a priority queue to maintain your best hand and try out each possibility.

Idea is keep K best performers and whenever you enter a new element just try to find the best possible answer
you can with this element and compare it with the global maximum.

practice the following to get a good grasp ;)

## Leetcode 2542. Maximum Subsequence Score

_Leetcode 1383 is ditto(almost) same as above_

## Leetcode 502. IPO

## Leetcode 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers

_This one is a good one_

## Leetcode 2813. Maximum Elegance of a K-Length Subsequence

## Leetcode 2071. Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign
(Combination of tpics question)
