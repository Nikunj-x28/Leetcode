Suppose you have a mxn grid.
(Use a pen and paper.)
Let dp[i][j] be the sum of rectange from top left corner (0,0) to
(i,j).
then we have
take indexing of dp 1 based and initialize it with 0.
We can think of it as being surrounded by 0s at the left and top boundary.
dp[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j-1]+dp[i-1][j]+dp[i][j-1]-dp[i-1][j-1];
