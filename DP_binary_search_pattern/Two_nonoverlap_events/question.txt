Two Best Non-Overlapping Events
You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array of events where events[i] = [startTimei, endTimei, valuei]. The ith
event starts at startTimei and ends at endTimei, and if you attend this event, 
you will receive a value of value i. You can choose at most two non-overlapping events to attend such
that the sum of their values is maximized.

Return this maximum sum.
Note that the start time and end time is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them
starts and the other ends at the same time.

Test Cases:
Input: events = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[2,4,3]]
Output: 4
