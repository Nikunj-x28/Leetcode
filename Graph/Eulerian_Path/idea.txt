Suppose you plan a travel trip and visit many cities. But you forgot the order and only have train tickets from City A - City B.
To find the exact order of your travel what can you do ?
IF we take each city as a node in a graph and each ticket as an edge we have a simplified problem. Finding a path in the graph that
traverses all edges and too exactly once.
Such a path is called as the Eulerian Path. And if the start and end node are same it is called the Eulerian Circuit.

To solve it we can use Hierholzer Algorithm (O(E) T.C);
