Here we have two types of multisource and have to find the point where they will meet.

In a region consisting of N towns, there are M bidirectional roads connecting these towns.
Each road is of equal length. In this region, there are two types of armies stationed: the Red Army and the Blue Army.
The Red Army is stationed in R distinct towns, and the Blue Army is stationed in B distinct towns, with no town
hosting both a Red and a Blue army unit simultaneously.

Find the minimum amount of time required for any two armies of different colors to clash.
It is known that an army can travel from one town to another across any road in exactly one day. Consider
all possible paths and scenarios in which the two armies might travel and clash. Armies can move independently 
and simultaneously.
If two armies can never clash, then print "-1".

Input
The first line contains two integers N and M
the number of towns and the number of bidirectional roads respectively.
The second line contains N integers, where each integer is either 0 (no army), 1 (Blue army), or 2 (Red army),
representing the presence of an army in each town.
The next M lines each contain two integers u and v
representing a bidirectional road between towns u and v.

Output
The minimum number of days required for any two armies of different colors (one Red and one Blue) to meet,
assuming they start traveling towards each other at the same time.

If red and blue armies can never clash, then print "-1".
