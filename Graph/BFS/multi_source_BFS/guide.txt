What is multi source BFS ?

Usuallly we encounter BFS problems where we have a single starting point and we start traversal from there.
But certain problems require that we have multiple starting positions.

Imagine a group of people starting the search together . If one of them finds a solution or destination all of them
have found it right. This is the intuition behind multi source BFS.

So these are basically problems where multiple nodes will be first put in a queue and then we start a BFS.

Sometimes we may also have two groups or more. That is imagine now their are two groups of people and both are
searching for the other group . How do we tackle this in a BFS ?
We have to insert both groups in the BFS queue and then start traversal but how do we decide when they meet ?
For this and many other similar single source problems we modify the defintion of a node so that we can 
uniquely identify it. 
Here a node will be {position + group number}.
Example 1 illustrates this very particular Problem and its solution.
