370. Range Addition
Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.
Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which increments each element of
subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.
Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.

Accumulate +update in start and -update in end+1
After that sweep the line and accumulate sum in a variable and keep assigning to every index.
