Given two strings S and T, find length of the shortest subsequence in S which is not a subsequence in T.
If no such subsequence is possible, return -1. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same 
relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. A string of length n has 2^n different possible subsequences.

 
Test Cases:

Example 1:

Input:
S = "babab"
T = "babba"
Output:
3
Explanation:
There are no subsequences of S with
length less than 3 which is not a
subsequence of T. "aab" is an example of
a subsequence of length 3 which isn't a
subsequence of T.

Example 2:

Input:
S = "babhi"
T = "babij"
Output:
1
Explanation:
"h" is a subsequence of S that is
not a subsequence of T.
