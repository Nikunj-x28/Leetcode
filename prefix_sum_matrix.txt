Let DP[i,j] denote sum till ith row and jth column.
then DP[i,j] = DP[i,j-1]+DP[i-1,j] - DP[i-1,j-1]
you can find this relation by drawing up a matrix.

Then to find a subMatrix in Matrix which has the specific sum.
Either choose two rows then iterate for column .
R1      R2
go from column 0 column last
Use an unordered map to keep track of submatrix sum just like subarray with sum k.
