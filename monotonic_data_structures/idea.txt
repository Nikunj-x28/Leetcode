Whenever in a problem you need to maintain information about the smallest or the largest elements found yet
and if for some reason that smallest number becomes invalid we need to know the  next smallest number to its
right this is a hint of a monotonic structure.
If having problmes thinking about how to use a queue,stack or deque first use
a priority_queue to arrive at the solution then it becomes very easy to replace the priority_queue logic
with other faster monotonic data structures.
