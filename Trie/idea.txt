The most crucial idea about when to use Trie is ->
When we need to perform prefix searches efficiently.
For example ->

a b c d 
a b d f 
b b c d 
b b d e 

if our search logic considers same prefix equally ..
    i.e we have somewhat the following logical search space use Trie.
     a     b
     |     |
     b     b
     /\    /\
     c d   c d
     | |   | |
     d f   d e
